# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals and Front End Web Development Courses. I was given a starter template that did not include any code written in React. This is a Book Tracking Application. Use the arrows to move books between the shelves. Select none to remove the book completely. Click the + icon to search for books and add them to any one of the shelves. If a book does not have a shelf "none" will be selected by default.
## How to get started

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students and is submitted for grading. Therefore I can not accept contribution.
