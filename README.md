# MyReads Project

This is the starter template for the assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals and Front End Web Development Courses. I was given a starter template that did not include any code written in React. This is a Book Tracking Application. Use the arrows to move books between the shelves. Select none to remove the book completely. Click the + icon to search for books and add them to any one of the shelves. If a book does not have a shelf "none" will be selected by default.
## How to use
* download or clone 
* using a terminal cd to the path of the project ex (cd Desktop/myreads-react)
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
Only a particular set of search terms will work with this applictation which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md]. That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend. 

## Dependencies 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

React Router Dom  (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students and is submitted for grading. Therefore I can not accept contribution.
